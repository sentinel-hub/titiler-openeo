    "# Lego Tile User Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the complete workflow for interacting with the Lego tile services. It shows how to:\n",
    "1. Authenticate using OIDC\n",
    "2. Claim a tile to build\n",
    "3. Release a tile (if unable to complete)\n",
    "4. Commit a tile (when completed)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For web developers implementing this workflow in React, see the [auth_example.jsx](auth_example.jsx) file for a complete authentication implementation including PKCE flow and token renewal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tile Ownership**: Each tile can only be claimed by one user at a time\n",
    "- **User Verification**: Only the user who claimed a tile can release or commit it\n",
    "- **State Management**: Tiles progress through states: available → claimed → released/submitted\n",
    "- **Grid Dimensions**: 26x27 tiles at zoom level 7\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "First, we'll import the required libraries and set up our connection."
