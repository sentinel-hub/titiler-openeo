    """
    The `@process` decorator handles parameter resolution in the OpenEO processing pipeline.

    This decorator is a crucial component in OpenEO's data processing architecture:

    1. Parameter Resolution Flow:
       - OpenEO process graphs are parsed by openeo_pg_parser_networkx which creates ParameterReference objects
       - These references must be resolved to actual values before process execution
       - The decorator handles this resolution by mapping references to actual parameters

    2. Integration with STAC:
       - When loading data (e.g., via load_collection), parameters get passed through the processing chain
       - The decorator ensures proper parameter passing between STAC API interactions and process execution

    3. Parameter Types:
       - Positional parameters: Used by processes like 'apply' that need position-based arguments
       - Named parameters: Standard key-value parameter mapping
       - Special parameters: Handled automatically for compatibility (axis, keepdims, etc.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    positional_parameters : dict, optional
        Maps parameter positions to names, enabling parent processes to pass
        positional arguments to child processes
    named_parameters : dict, optional
        Maps parameter names to their resolved values

    Example
    -------
    ```python
    @process
    def compute_ndvi(red: float, nir: float) -> float:
        return (nir - red) / (nir + red)

    # When used in a process graph:
    result = compute_ndvi(
        from_parameter="red_band",  # Will be resolved by the decorator
        from_parameter="nir_band"   # Will be resolved by the decorator
    )
    ```

    Raises
    ------
    ProcessParameterMissing
        If a required parameter reference cannot be resolved
