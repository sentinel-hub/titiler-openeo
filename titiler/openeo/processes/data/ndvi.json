    "description": "Computes the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The NDVI is computed as *`(nir - red) / (nir + red)`*.\n\nThe `data` parameter expects a raster data cube with a dimension of type `bands` or a `DimensionAmbiguous` exception is thrown otherwise. By default, the dimension must have at least two bands with the common names `red` and `nir` assigned. Otherwise, the user has to specify the parameters `nir` and `red`. If neither is the case, either the exception `NirBandAmbiguous` or `RedBandAmbiguous` is thrown. The common names for each band are specified in the collection's band metadata and are *not* equal to the band names.\n\nBy default, the dimension of type `bands` is dropped by this process. To keep the dimension specify a new band name in the parameter `target_band`. This adds a new dimension label with the specified name to the dimension, which can be used to access the computed values. If a band with the specified name exists, a `BandExists` is thrown.\n\nThis process is very similar to the process ``normalized_difference()``, but determines the bands automatically based on the common names (`red`/`nir`) specified in the metadata.",
